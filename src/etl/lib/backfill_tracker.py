"""
The Glass - Backfill Coverage Tracker

Tracks historical stats backfill completeness by persisting a deterministic
coverage signature for each (entity_type, season, season_type, source_key)
in ``ops.coverages``.

When the required call-group surface changes (for example, a new DB column is
added), the signature changes and the next backfill run reprocesses that
entity/season automatically.
